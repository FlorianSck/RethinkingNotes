Bayesian inference is distinguished by a broad view of probability, not by the use of
Bayes' theorem. A central part explained here is the working with samples from the 
posterior distribution, to make inference in the style of questions for the defined
model easier. This is opposed to the classic integral calculus you utilize when 
usually working with distribution functions. With this method, instead of using these
mathematical formulas for integration, you can just use standard data summary methods-

My favorite quote from the first section of the chapter:

#### **Rethinking:** Hypothesis-Testing

Scientific inference process: (1) An hypothesis is true or false; (2) we calculate a 
statistical measure to determine if the hypothesis is likely to be true/false; (3) one
*should* use Bayes theorem to deduce the impact of our measurement on the original 
hypothesis. 
The example: suppose the probability of a positive finding when the hypothesis is true 
(*power*), is Pr(sig$|$true)$=0.95$, and that the probability of a positive finding 
when the hypothesis is false is Pr(sig$|$false)$=0.05$ (*false positive rate*, like the
conventional 5% in significance testing). Additionally, suppose that 1 in every 100 
hypothesis is true, Pr(true)$=0.01$. 
Thus, in this scenario, we can calculate Pr(true$|$pos)$=0.16$, meaning a positive finding
corresponds to a probability of 16% that the hypothesis is true. An shrinking of the 
false-positve rate to 1% does not solve this problem, merely improving the posterior
probability to a 0.5. Pr(true) is the most essential rate in this setting, for which
thinking is required, not testing.
